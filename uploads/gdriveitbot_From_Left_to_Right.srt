1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,480
I decided to do a video this week maybe to help people on trying to understand why they

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:20,240
are still not profitable or at least haven't made a little bit of money in the market.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,680
There's a reason, and very rarely it's a technical reason, sometimes it's because

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,720
members probably don't understand the strategy very well but based on what I saw it's always

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,600
and almost always mostly psychology.

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,520
It seems like there's a pattern that is being built amongst traders, not only you guys everybody

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:58,200
and even me back in the day, and it's patience, the urge of making the money now, the FOMO,

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:06,680
even though some of you guys trade on a $100 account, FOMO and also kind of seeing stuff

9
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,880
in the market that isn't really, how can I say it, that isn't really a thing.

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:27,160
So we'll give an example, I received a question I think two days ago, this was yesterday,

11
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:34,880
so I received a question of a member who actually saw this, he saw this inducement on the left,

12
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,160
and this video will be all pretty much mixed, it's going to be like a weekly call because

13
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,480
I want to get this out of my chest and try to help most of you guys.

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,680
So as you can see there's speed and momentum inducing most likely this Asia midline decisional

15
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,920
POI, even though structural expectations are bullish, most likely intraday here we have

16
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,260
clear liquidity being built, remember it doesn't mean that structural expectation is bullish

17
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,760
that we cannot build sell side liquidity, it's possible.

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,760
There's speed and momentum, and there's here a new low made confirming the tradeaway.

19
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,400
Very important, so when you read the chart, and this is going to be me giving you my tips,

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:30,520
you read the chart from left to right, so here we have this making this low, perfect

21
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,960
stop losses, coming back, faking, faking, faking, even better, right?

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,820
False reaction, inducement high, right?

23
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:48,240
So we have one data, oops, one evidence, maybe second evidence because of those multiple

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,480
touches of this point, right?

25
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Then third, perfect.

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,920
Then here, fourth, inducement, this is a false reaction just so you guys know, look how long

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,920
it takes to switch, it's unbelievable, trading view is just horrible, okay?

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,960
Now new low here made, so that would be five, right?

29
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,840
And then, oh, reaction from daily low.

30
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,000
So let's do this because if I copy it's going to glitch, six, right?

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Perfect.

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:40,160
Then you have some people take the short, you have a reaction of the Asia high PY, and

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:53,800
some members decided to take some shorts over here, right?

34
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,500
And this is because they don't do this pat, right?

35
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Maybe we can call this video the pat to success or the story, right?

36
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,420
And this is exactly what I do in my brain, okay?

37
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,500
So as you can see, you have the steps, and this is members decide to deliberately ignore

38
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,540
this, see?

39
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:32,420
They decide to also ignore this, this, or they just see this and this, see?

40
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:40,420
You cannot ignore, and there's even like, let's say a high made here, so that would

41
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,400
be like seven, right?

42
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:51,540
So you cannot decide to take a trade and ignore clear evidences of the chart, okay?

43
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,820
And this is an example I wanted to give because, and then I asked the member, he took a short

44
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
like this.

45
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,340
He said, oh, it's been in momentum to mitigation, and then I did this, and prices are this,

46
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,660
and he felt pissed.

47
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:14,820
And I asked him how many, and then I asked him how many times in your journal, in your

48
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:22,300
research, in your data that you have built over the past months with the shelter, how

49
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:29,820
many times out of 10, let's say, out of 10, it's simple, 10 trade samples has this kind

50
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,380
of setup worked?

51
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:47,100
From an inducement of Asia high against structural expectation, no real liquidity created, right?

52
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,180
Because right now there's, it's buy side liquidity being built.

53
00:05:52,180 --> 00:06:01,860
So we have liquidity here, and we're about to have relevant one here because it made

54
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,860
a new high.

55
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,740
But we do have it like these zones here, even though it's late in the day, when they enter

56
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:15,500
here and push, as you can see here, pretty straightforward, boom, boom, boom, right?

57
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,300
So this would also be like, this would be the six, this would be the seven, and this

58
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,580
would be the eight, right?

59
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,200
Because I forgot to mark the liquidity here.

60
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:35,960
So you're trading against the liquidity, you decide to ignore point eight, seven, six,

61
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,000
and you just tunnel vision point four.

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,440
Price needs to be read from left to right.

63
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,040
You cannot ignore something.

64
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,660
It's a no, no, you can't, you just can't, okay?

65
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,180
So let's see what happens after, I think price just continues.

66
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,140
And this is super important.

67
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:08,100
And as you can see here, when it comes down to other point, let's erase this, erase this,

68
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,860
this, this would be an SMT, right?

69
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,460
Oops, SMT, you could mark now, like maybe because this in turn, even though this internal

70
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,420
break is most likely not so relevant.

71
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,180
I like the fact that a retest is here, right?

72
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,620
Breaking retest.

73
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,660
So this would be the first break of the entry day.

74
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,740
I think that a break and retest here is pretty nice.

75
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,100
And especially it makes a new high here with speed and momentum.

76
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,400
So I think that there's relevance here.

77
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,900
See how I adjust, see how I justify, see, and as you can see here, maybe this took this

78
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,340
little reaction.

79
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:58,100
Then it came back into the inducement PY from these equal lows.

80
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,420
This is most likely maybe a predicted low.

81
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Who knows?

82
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,300
It made a new high.

83
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,500
It created the FBOS, right?

84
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,980
Engineering most likely the SMT here, right?

85
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,660
We talked about that on another call.

86
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:22,460
So do you see the reasons why some of you guys are not consistent yet?

87
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:30,260
And now you can see here, the SMT here, inducement, and there's a potential trade away here.

88
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,860
Unfortunately, this was most likely a pullback because we have the decisional, the inducement

89
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
PY.

90
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,580
And the reason why some of you guys don't make money because you don't transform the

91
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,300
strategy into a mechanical approach.

92
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:57,420
I 100% agree that in some cases, liquidity markups can be a little bit subjective.

93
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,900
Some traders will have two different vision.

94
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,300
This is 100% true when it comes down to markup.

95
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:16,060
When it comes down to liquidity taken, the outcome cannot be subjective.

96
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,740
And this is why sometimes I do adjustments, and you saw me doing it in my technicals.

97
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:27,080
I adjust the chart based on newest evidence and based on details that the candle printed

98
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
for me.

99
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,080
How can you have bad markups if the chart actually gives you everything, gives you the

100
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,680
details, right?

101
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,120
And in this case, where would be the trade, right?

102
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:49,680
Pretty much pretty, pretty easy, right?

103
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,360
Can I just remove this?

104
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
This is me off.

105
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,920
Where would be the trade?

106
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,800
Very, very easy, right?

107
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
As you can see here, there's a mitigation.

108
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,000
You go here.

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,480
Price leaves here, makes this relevant break of structure, comes back into the mitigation.

110
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,920
And here we go.

111
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,880
Right?

112
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
And this is a trade I took.

113
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:29,800
I didn't sell to anybody because they would have killed me, but I actually took this trade.

114
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,880
It was the fourth, yeah.

115
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,440
I think we're in the live trading call.

116
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,640
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

117
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,800
Again, read the price in orders.

118
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,400
What are the evidence?

119
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,620
Let's continue the practice.

120
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,500
This is a very good practice, okay?

121
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,780
What is the structural expectation, right?

122
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:05,180
Point number one is price failed to make a new low, right?

123
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,180
Here, end of day.

124
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,180
Okay?

125
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,540
Now, two, price decides to create kind of equal highs.

126
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,540
Very interesting.

127
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,700
Very, very interesting.

128
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,940
Now, oops.

129
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,500
Now price makes a new low.

130
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,340
Maybe if I do this, it's faster.

131
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,900
Price makes a new low.

132
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,460
So this would be solidification of those equal highs.

133
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,260
Lovely, right?

134
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,460
Do we have relevant liquidity on the sell side?

135
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,460
You can see.

136
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,260
It's not relevant because there's no reaction.

137
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,980
So a lot of people would say, oh, there's stop losses here.

138
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,980
You can do this.

139
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,260
But once it comes here and it doesn't give you any reaction, don't mark up shit, okay?

140
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,820
Now we have faking equal lows.

141
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,380
These equal lows are important.

142
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Why?

143
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,140
Because they are in line with structural expectation.

144
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,060
So this is the new low.

145
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,200
This is the equal lows, right?

146
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,180
We have false reaction.

147
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,520
Ooh, juicy.

148
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,420
We have inducement, right?

149
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,260
And now when there's an inducement of Asia low, what do we do?

150
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,820
We look to the left.

151
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,300
Ooh, potential protected low.

152
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,700
Potential protected low, right?

153
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Asia midline.

154
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Lovely.

155
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,780
So now there's an inducement.

156
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,660
There's clear liquidity target.

157
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,020
There's a mitigation on the left.

158
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,060
Speed and momentum.

159
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,860
Maybe it's time to take a trade, right?

160
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,460
Let's go and see if we have something on the M1.

161
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Lovely.

162
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Lovely POI.

163
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Very, very simple, right?

164
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,100
As you can see, mitigation, right?

165
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,980
I would be taking a trade most likely on the way up after this internal break.

166
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
Here we go.

167
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,060
I would wait for this.

168
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,060
Price comes back.

169
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,060
Speed and momentum.

170
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,860
Instant buy.

171
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,860
And you target the equal highs.

172
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,340
Now let's do and let's do our due diligence.

173
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,660
And this is basically what I say by doing our due diligence.

174
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:26,460
We took a trade based on number six, five, four, three, two, and one.

175
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,860
All these are in line with the same idea.

176
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,580
If there's one of the numbers, let's say here, let's type it.

177
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,980
Oh, God damn it.

178
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,980
What have I done?

179
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,980
God damn it.

180
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,140
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,140
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
Let's type them down, right?

183
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,140
Hey, this is annoying.

184
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,140
Failed to make a new low.

185
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,140
End of date.

186
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,140
God damn it.

187
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,140
All right.

188
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,140
Equal, equal highs, right?

189
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,300
From this pullback.

190
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
Very lovely.

191
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:20,300
Number three is new low created.

192
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Confirming equal lows, equal highs.

193
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,300
All right.

194
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Let me just take a sip.

195
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Four.

196
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:49,460
Equal lows confirmed by multiple touches and respecting structural expectations.

197
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Lovely.

198
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,460
False reaction of equal lows.

199
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
Solidifying the liquidity.

200
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,460
Solidifying the liquidity.

201
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,620
Very, very lovely.

202
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,620
Number six.

203
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:28,620
Speed and momentum inducing equal lows and also Asia low.

204
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,780
Mitigation momentum.

205
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,780
Mitigational from previous date.

206
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,780
Decisional.

207
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,780
Let's put DPY.

208
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,780
Maybe a protected low.

209
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
Who knows?

210
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,780
See, let's continue.

211
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Number eight.

212
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,780
Inducement of equal highs.

213
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,780
All right.

214
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,780
Little nine.

215
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,780
Little pullback from inducement of equal highs.

216
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:25,780
Most likely just relative.

217
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,940
Relative equal highs with not much liquidity.

218
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,940
This has been justified.

219
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,940
By the reaction.

220
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
After.

221
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,940
Inducement.

222
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,940
Right.

223
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,940
If this equal highs would be super relevant like this one, we would have made a new low, right?

224
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
We just have a little pullback and it continues.

225
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
We're just engineering more liquidity.

226
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
This is lovely.

227
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,100
It's a mess, but I'm trying to explain to you guys why some of you guys are so lost.

228
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Because you don't do your due diligence.

229
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
You don't go step by step.

230
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
You cannot justify every single movement.

231
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
You just see liquidity.

232
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
You just see breakout and you don't ask yourself questions.

233
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
And this is a problem.

234
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Price pushes.

235
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Do we have something to the left?

236
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
No.

237
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
There is a retracement.

238
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,260
Then.

239
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,260
Retracement.

240
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,260
Most likely.

241
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,260
To take liquidity.

242
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,260
Perfect.

243
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,260
Maybe even break and retest.

244
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,260
Who knows?

245
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,260
Lovely, right?

246
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,260
Speed and momentum into it.

247
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,260
Now price comes here.

248
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,260
Revisits the zone.

249
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,260
Let's go check if there's something on the higher time frame.

250
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,420
Not really.

251
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
Let's check 30 minutes.

252
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,420
Not really.

253
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,420
So it's most likely the only thing it's doing.

254
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,420
It's taking this liquidity.

255
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,420
And maybe it's enough.

256
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,420
Maybe we have breakout traders entering here.

257
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
And maybe this is breaking them even.

258
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,420
Right?

259
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
We don't know.

260
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,420
So number 10.

261
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
11.

262
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,420
After inducement.

263
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,420
We get.

264
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,580
A reaction.

265
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
Here.

266
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,580
First reaction.

267
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,580
Do we have a new high?

268
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
No.

269
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
But we have these two structures equaling.

270
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,580
Like this.

271
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,580
For me it's the same thing.

272
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,580
Relevant breakout structure.

273
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,580
Internal breakout structure.

274
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,580
I already said it.

275
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,580
After inducement.

276
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,580
We get a reaction.

277
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
Very good.

278
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
From the inducement.

279
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,740
Of the breakouts.

280
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
And.

281
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,740
Breakouts.

282
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
And break and retest.

283
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
And the break and retest are a little bit pulled by the hair.

284
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
Because of this structure here.

285
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
But you get the idea.

286
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,740
It's a breakout or break and retest.

287
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
We don't really care.

288
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
Then we have a retest of that POI.

289
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,740
Filling the imbalance.

290
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
Mitigation.

291
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
Oh, wait a minute.

292
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Enticement zone.

293
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Still in play.

294
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
Do we have clear liquidity here?

295
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Maybe.

296
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
Maybe.

297
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
So we can add a little bit of liquidity here.

298
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
Possible.

299
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,900
But this is inducement.

300
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
So this is a trade away.

301
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
And I'm not going to take all the video to explain everything that I do.

302
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,900
This is how I do my daily markups.

303
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
If.

304
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
You want to be.

305
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,060
Profitable.

306
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,060
You need to bring this mechanical approach.

307
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,060
Of what does the chart.

308
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,060
Tells me.

309
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,060
I would have taken this trade.

310
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,060
Anytime.

311
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,060
The problem is I have too many opportunities.

312
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,060
And I just can't be involved in all these trades.

313
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,060
My brain will just explode.

314
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
But these trades are so easy.

315
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,060
Look the way I trade.

316
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
I see these structures.

317
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,060
I put an alert here.

318
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,060
Here.

319
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
And since I identified.

320
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,220
That maybe we have a little bit of liquidity here.

321
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,220
I put an alert here.

322
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
First one that triggers I see if there is a reaction.

323
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,220
That's it.

324
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,220
That's in a nutshell.

325
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,220
How I trade.

326
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,220
You need to have steps by step.

327
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
This 11.

328
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,220
Cannot ignore the 10.

329
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Or you cannot ignore the 6.

330
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Look how the 11.

331
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
The 10.

332
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
The 9.

333
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
All in line.

334
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,380
But if we go back into.

335
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,380
Our EU here.

336
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,380
Our GU here.

337
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,380
It's not.

338
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,380
In the same.

339
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,380
Like the 8.

340
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,380
Here.

341
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,380
The 7.

342
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
The mitigation of previous daily low.

343
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
Most likely an inducement of the S&T.

344
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,380
The new low confirmed.

345
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,380
The speed and momentum.

346
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,380
Of these new lows.

347
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,540
Most likely this is an S&T.

348
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,540
This is a new low.

349
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,540
Maybe an EVBOS.

350
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,540
See how.

351
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,540
The 8.

352
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,540
For taking this trade.

353
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,540
Remember people were taking this trade here.

354
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,540
Like this.

355
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,540
Do you see how.

356
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,540
These numbers are not.

357
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,540
In sync.

358
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
The correlation between them.

359
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,540
Is not in sync.

360
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
And look at this one.

361
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,700
Everything is in line.

362
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,700
With the trade idea.

363
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,700
This one or this one.

364
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,700
At the second you have something.

365
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
It's like if you're putting.

366
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
A fake.

367
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Like something that is not.

368
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
Part of the dish.

369
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Of the ingredient.

370
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Of the recipe.

371
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,700
You're adding an ingredient.

372
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
That doesn't has it's place there.

373
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
So the reason I know.

374
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,700
And I know.

375
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,860
I know I'm wrong telling you guys this.

376
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,860
I know some of you guys will say.

377
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,860
It's psychology.

378
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,860
But sometimes.

379
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,860
From what I see.

380
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,860
Psychology can kind of slip.

381
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,860
Into the technicals.

382
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,860
Because you deliberately.

383
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,860
Decide to ignore something.

384
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,860
And do something.

385
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,860
That I have never shown.

386
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,860
And when I ask the members.

387
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,860
The question.

388
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
How many times have you seen this.

389
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
And indeed.

390
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,020
They can't answer.

391
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,020
And this is not trading.

392
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,020
If you cannot quantify the data.

393
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,020
Of your entry models.

394
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,020
If you're not journaling your trade.

395
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,020
To know exactly what works.

396
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,020
You guys see all my trades.

397
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,020
They are similar.

398
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
Why?

399
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,020
Because I know what I like.

400
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
I know what I'm doing.

401
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
Because I've tested it multiple times.

402
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,020
Why don't you quantify the data.

403
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,180
And just.

404
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Spam this bitch.

405
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,180
Like insanely.

406
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,180
Just spam it.

407
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,180
Do it.

408
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,180
Trading is very rewarding.

409
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,180
But it's rewarding for people.

410
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,180
That actually put in the effort.

411
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
To improve.

412
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,180
If you're not doing everything.

413
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,180
In your power.

414
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,180
And you decide to.

415
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,180
When you take a trade.

416
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,180
To ignore this.

417
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,340
You ignore the fact.

418
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,340
That you have right now.

419
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Evidences that tells you.

420
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,340
Not to take the trade.

421
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,340
And you have evidences.

422
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,340
That you basically don't have evidences.

423
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,340
That this trade will work.

424
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,340
Taking a trade from Asia high.

425
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,340
You never back tested this.

426
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,340
This never works.

427
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,340
You don't have the data quantified.

428
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
Then why are you taking the trade?

429
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,340
I want to be able to take a trade.

430
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,340
And be able to cut my hand in half.

431
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Because I'm 100% confident.

432
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
That I did everything in my power.

433
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
To do my due diligence.

434
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
To actually understand.

435
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Why I'm taking this trade.

436
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Trust me.

437
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Oh my god.

438
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Trust me.

439
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
It takes time.

440
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
But it's so rewarding.

441
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Back in the day.

442
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
I failed so much FTMOs.

443
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
But if you go check my overall.

444
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
Withdrawal in FTMO.

445
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,660
So it doesn't matter how much money you lose.

446
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,660
You will make it back.

447
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,660
But you need to continue.

448
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,660
And you need to take this seriously.

449
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Because we know that some of you guys don't take this seriously.

450
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
And we see it based on the markups.

451
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
You do mechanical markups.

452
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,660
You don't ask yourself questions.

453
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,660
Like the way I do it here.

454
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,660
I want to ask myself questions.

455
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,660
On the chart.

456
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
To build this experience.

457
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
And to be able.

458
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
To record it in my brain.

459
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,820
And actually translate it into life.

460
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,820
It sounds stupid.

461
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,820
But the more you practice.

462
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,820
To do something.

463
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,820
Even though it's not.

464
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,820
Continuously trading.

465
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,820
Actually executing trades.

466
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,820
But you will.

467
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,820
Actually make it.

468
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,820
It's like if you're learning a piano song.

469
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,820
And you constantly practice on your desk.

470
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,820
Without the piano.

471
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,820
Just with the hand movements.

472
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,980
Imagine the piano in front of you.

473
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,980
Your hands.

474
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,980
Your muscle memory.

475
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,980
Will build over time.

476
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,980
And this will be translated into life.

477
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,980
Piano playing.

478
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,980
So.

479
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,980
I hope this helps.

480
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,980
I still don't know how I'm going to call this video.

481
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,980
Maybe like.

482
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Rating the chart.

483
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,980
Or.

484
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,980
Maybe like.

485
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,980
From left to right.

486
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,140
Because we're actually.

487
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,140
This is what I'm saying.

488
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,140
You cannot see this.

489
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,140
You need to identify everything.

490
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,140
And every step one behind the other.

491
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,140
This is a complete mess.

492
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
Needs to be.

493
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
In line with your idea.

494
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
So I think it's.

495
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
A very important video.

496
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,140
Do not underestimate this video.

497
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,140
And if you're not.

498
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,140
Where you want to be right now.

499
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,140
It's most likely.

500
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
It's also a lot.

501
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,300
About psychology.

502
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,300
But psychology can also impact.

503
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
Your actual technical knowledge.

504
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,300
So make sure you think about that.

505
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,300
And if there's anything.

506
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,300
You guys let me know.

507
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
And I'll catch you guys all in discord.

508
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,300
Peace.
